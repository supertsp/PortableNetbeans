Have you thought about taking Netbeans anywhere with your saved settings and customizations?

This project saves your personal settings in the following folders:

* **assets:** in this folder are image files used in splash screen and other nice things
* **jdks:** in this folder you put the version you want from JDK or OpenJDK. Note: default is 11 for better compatibility
* **m2LocalRepository:** in this folder all the Maven settings and downloads are saved
* **netbeans:** in this folder is the installation of Netbeans
* **user:** This folder automatically saves configuration files for personal preferences, shortcuts, customizations, code templates, etc.
