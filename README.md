# netbeansPortable
Although Netbeans does not need to be installed on Windows to work, it has dependency on the JDK and saves the configuration files in the user's folder. So, this portable version solves all these problems. Note: All files and codes created exclusively in this project are under the GNU / GPL v.3 license, however Netbeans has its own licenses.
