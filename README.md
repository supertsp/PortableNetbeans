# Netbeans Portable Project
Although [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) does not need to be installed on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/software-download/windows10) to work, it has dependency on the [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and saves the configuration files in the user's folder.
So, this portable version solves all these problems.
